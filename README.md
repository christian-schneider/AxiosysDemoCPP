Hello Konstantinos and Shadow, welcome to my "solution-story" for my Cave Of Trials :)

When I first read the assignment I was impressed with the work amount
of the task, as I have one day per week, so in total two days 
for completing the assignment. I understood that this is also a part of the test, 
on how I am going to deal with this and descide on what I actually will work on. 
So let's dive in on my though and solution process. 

First I was looking up on the different abilities that the custom component 
should implement and wanted to find good Blueprint implementations. 
Although it is for a third person type and not FPS, I liked this videos
for vaulting and climbing:

I also implemented crouching and sprinting with stamina drain in BP in this project, 
to have everything ready for moving to C++. Find the UE 5 project for engine version 5.7.1 here:
